In this CA, I created an API using Microsoft Visual Studio and SQL to store data.
A mobile client was built (using Angular and Ionic) implementing the API. 
The methods in the repositories were successful and tested usng POSTMAN in terms of Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting Data.
The Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting of data was successful. 

Although the mobile client could read data using the API, mobile client failed to insert, update or delete data in the SQL database.
