In this project, I have created a Mobile App using Ionic, Angular and Firebase. This application deals with books.

Cloud Firestore is used to store the data (i.e, users, books) in collections and documents.

The user must sign up in order to log in and access the application. Google Authentication is an option to login.

The user has an option to view all books in addition to inserting, updating and deleting books in the Firebase Database. 

Issues: Google Authentication did not work on the mobile, only worked on web.
