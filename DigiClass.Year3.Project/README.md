Year 3 Group Project (Team of 3)

DigiClass is an Online Grinds System allocated to Leaving Certificate Students and Teachers to connect. The idea was brought about during the COVID-19 pandemic whereas students and teachers would find difficulty physically giving grinds lessons outside school hours. 

On this application, both Students and Teachers have the option to register and design their profile.

Teachers

• Have the ability to Create courses allocated to the subjects they are professional in e.g. English, Mathematics. Creating courses also involves setting a start date, end date, and the number of students allowed to join that specific course. 

• The message board system is available to Teachers and this involves the teacher publishing links to physical calls and work that has to be done for that week. 

Students

• Students have many different functions including signing up for an existing course that a Teacher has set up as long as it hasn't started or within a small number of days after the start date of the course. 

• Students can also, drop out of a course if they are not happy, and this will not affect the student much as the course fees are paid monthly.

Administrator

• The administrator has the option to verify a teacher when the teacher has uploaded their details as well as the highest qualification they have. 

• Administrators can also activate and disable any user regardless of the type e.g. Student/Teacher.
